## What does Datafast Runtime do?

‚ù§Ô∏è  Performance-focus - it is built to prioritize indexing speed

‚ù§Ô∏è  Blockchain data reusability - block data is stored in Object Storage for reusability, eliminating cost of calling JSON-RPC over and over again for the same data

‚ù§Ô∏è  Blockchain data is smartly organized & compressed using Databricks' DeltaLake technology plus Protobuf on top for storage-efficiency, very fast serialization, very fast to ingest and unlimited scalability

‚ù§Ô∏è  Indexed data is stored in NoSQL database to reduce database cost yet still fast in retrieval

‚ù§Ô∏è  Allowing user to specify a limit time to keep output data in store, like last 6 months or last year - help reduce data storage cost by remove outdated data

‚ù§Ô∏è  Graceful reorg-handling

‚ù§Ô∏è  Extensible - as Datafast code base is way simpler and extensible than graph-node, allowing user to freely implement more features without crying for help

‚ù§Ô∏è  No need IPFS!

‚ù§Ô∏è  No GAS required for indexing!



## What Datafast Runtime cannot do...

‚ùå  Datafast Runtime is built to focus on the indexing-job. It does not come with a GraphQL query layer.



## üöß  Development Status

Datafast is built for educational & sharing purpose & not ready for production - since there are plenty of features that needs implementing & issues need addressing.&#x20;

Still, Datafast-Runtime can be used as a ground-work to build in-house blockchain indexing solution to replace GraphNode / TheGraph



## üî∞  Who is this runtime for?

* Companies who want to host their own subgraph data
* Companies who want to host their own subgraph data with efficient storage cost, with their own solution
* Developers who want to play around with their own version of Subgraph Indexing Engine
* Developers who want to play around with WebAssembly technology and build crazier stuffs with it.
